            <img src="images/hazel.jpg" alt="Yellow Labrador retriever standing in front of a glass door." width="400">

            <p>Hazel is a year-old yellow Labrador retriever that enjoys long walks 
                and playing catch (in or out of the water). She has a lot of energy, 
                so she gets restless if she does not have enough exercise. Hazel loves 
                meeting new people and seeing old friends. She likes to jump on people, 
                but she is friendly and does not mean any harm.</p>

            <p>Hazel will eat anything and everything. Like most Labrador retrievers, 
                she loves food and will eat things that are not actually edible. Some 
                of the things that Hazel has chewed on include hand towels, blankets, 
                Apple Airpods, and Halloween decorations. She also loves to eat human 
                food such as lettuce.</p>

            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <h2>Daisy</h2>
            <img src="images/daisy_defeats_snake.jpg" width="400" alt="Daisy is an 8 year old black and white Morkie (Maltese-Yorkie)">
            <p>When Daisy isn’t busy slaying all of the evil snakes trying to attack us (Pictured Above), you can usually find her annoying her older sister Marina, getting super hyper at completely random times, or relaxing in our backyard making sure she keeps out all of the intruders (squirrels)</p>
            <p>One of Daisy’s favorite things to do is beg to go on a walk, and then once we’re about half way done with the walk she likes to lay down and refuse to keep going. She then loves being carried all the way back from said walk, and the process will repeat again later in the day.</p>
