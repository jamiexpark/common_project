            <img src="images/hazel.jpg" alt="Yellow Labrador retriever standing in front of a glass door." width="400">

            <p>Hazel is a year-old yellow Labrador retriever that enjoys long walks 
                and playing catch (in or out of the water). She has a lot of energy, 
                so she gets restless if she does not have enough exercise. Hazel loves 
                meeting new people and seeing old friends. She likes to jump on people, 
                but she is friendly and does not mean any harm.</p>

            <p>Hazel will eat anything and everything. Like most Labrador retrievers, 
                she loves food and will eat things that are not actually edible. Some 
                of the things that Hazel has chewed on include hand towels, blankets, 
                Apple Airpods, and Halloween decorations. She also loves to eat human 
                food such as lettuce.</p>

            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <p>When Daisy isn’t busy slaying all of the evil snakes trying to attack us (Pictured Above), you can usually find her annoying her older sister Marina, getting super hyper at completely random times, or relaxing in our backyard making sure she keeps out all of the intruders (squirrels)</p>
            <p>One of Daisy’s favorite things to do is beg to go on a walk, and then once we’re about half way done with the walk she likes to lay down and refuse to keep going. She then loves being carried all the way back from said walk, and the process will repeat again later in the day.</p>

            <p>Terry is a playful and spirited dachshund that loves to play fetch with his bone or tennis ball. He loves wandering in forests and finding large sticks to take home. His favorite foods are kibble and peanut butter. Terry will run around frantically when it’s time to eat at home.</p>
            <p>My family found Terry at a shelter and decided to adopt it. He was 4 months old and is now 8 years old. Terry knows how to swim, but we don’t tend to go often. Terry got poison ivy once; however, he quickly recovered and has been doing great since</p>

            <p>Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get injured. Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes crazy and meows to go out.</p>
            <p>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside; a bee stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for four days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.</p>

            <p>Carter was born in Seattle. However, my brother bought him and brought him to Boston. Whenever my brother did not have time to walk Carter, he would put him on the treadmill. When Carter became too much of a responsibility for my brother as a college student, he took Carter to Vancouver to live with my mom, sister, and me. Because we lived in the mountains, he would sometimes howl in the middle of the night whenever he saw a wild animal.</p> 
            <P>Whenever I threw him a ball, he ran to the ball but never brought it back to me. He would sometimes escape the backyard of our house if we forgot to close the gates by accident. Even if we looked for him everywhere and did not find him, he knew the way home and always came back in the end. He loved going to the forest and the beach. He had his own spot on the living room couch and would television with us if he was bored or tired.</P>

            <p>Lucy is a 17-year-old calico that I've had since I was 5, she has pretty much grown up with me my whole life. Even though she’s old she’s still kickin’ it and enjoys running around the house at 4am.</p> 
            <P>Her favorite foods include anything but her kibble. She enjoys sunbathing and long naps, along with lots of petting. However, she hates getting her stomach rubbed.</P>
