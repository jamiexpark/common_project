                Tokyo, originally named Edo, emerged in 1603 as a fishing village. It quickly gained political power after a ‘Shogunate’, or dictatorship, took control of the area. Today Tokyo and its immediate surroundings are home to the most populated metropolitan area, with a staggering 37 million people residing in the region. Tokyo is also home to the largest urban economy in the world, and leads Japan in business and industrial economies.

                Tokyo is home to 23 special wards - areas like municipalities.These areas have increased monetary control over their immediate areas, with political powers such as their own mayor and assembly. Being the cultural, political, and business center of Japan, Tokyo is also home to a great public transport system. The city has two of its own commercial airports, as well as a super-express railway.
